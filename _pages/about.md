I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Child Mind Institute's Autism Center](https://childmind.org/bio/anish-k-simhal-phd/) where I'm researching graphs derived from MRI data of subjects with autism spectrum disorders. 

I completed graduate school at Duke University (PhD, 2019), studying image processing with Dr. Guillermo Sapiro where I researched methods for analyzing brain tissue labeled with fluorescent antibodies and imaged via light microscopy.  Specifically, I developed methods for detecting synapses in array tomography data without the need for training data and methods for characterizing the performance of synaptic antibodies. I also explored the role of astrocytes on synaptic density in mouse models of FXS syndrome.  Furthermore, I researched the effects of cord blood infusions on neurological development in children with autism spectrum disorder by analyzing their connectome (imaged via diffusion MRI).  

My publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NefDuV0AAAAJ&hl=en). Curriculum vitae is [here](https://aksimhal.github.io/files/simhal_cv.pdf). My CMI webpage is [here](https://childmind.org/bio/anish-k-simhal-phd/). 

I'm also the founder of [Bull City Classrooms](https://bullcityclassrooms.org), a Durham nonprofit that organizes volunteer events at elementary schools on Saturday mornings.
