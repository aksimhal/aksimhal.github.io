I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Child Mind Institute's Autism Center](https://childmind.org/bio/anish-k-simhal-phd/). My research focuses on network analysis to explore brain connectivity, focusing on using Ollivier-Ricci curvature to explore changes in the brain associated with autism. 

I graduated from Duke University (2019) with a PhD under the supervision of Dr. Guillermo Sapiro. There, I created novel methods for detecting and characterizing synapses in mouse brain tissue imaged via array tomography, a hyperspectral imaging method. Additionally, I developed a machine learning framework to detect cervical pre-cancers from multi-channel images collected during a colposcopy.
