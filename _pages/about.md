I completed graduate school at Duke University (PhD, 2019), studying image processing with Dr. Guillermo Sapiro. My current research focuses on the effects of cord blood infusions on neurological development in children with autism spectrum disorder by analyzing their connectome.  I also research methods for analyzing brain tissue labeled with fluorescent antibodies and imaged via light microscopy.

My publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NefDuV0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

I'm also the founder of [Bull City Classrooms](https://bullcityclassrooms.org), a Durham nonprofit that organizes volunteer events at elementary schools on Saturday mornings.
