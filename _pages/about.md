I am a postdoctoral researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Department of Medical Physics. With my advisors, Dr. Allen Tannenbaum & Dr. Joseph Deasy, I'm researching machine learning and graph analysis methods with applications in cancer. I enjoy working in sync with clinicians and biologists to go after pragmatic unsolved questions. 

While the focus of my research remains creating novel computer vision and machine learning methods, I have applied those tools to a variety of problems. Selected publications below are organized by application topic. 

The full list of publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NefDuV0AAAAJ&hl=en). Curriculum vitae is [here](https://aksimhal.github.io/files/simhal_cv.pdf). 


Newest publication 
----------
Using Ollivier-Ricci curvature (a measure of network robustness), we identified 118 genes previously unassociated with MM that identify a high risk subtype.

Graph Analysis & Diffusion Tensor MRI 
----------
These papers were the first to use a measure of network robustness, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, to analyze DTI images of children with ASD. The papers showed the differences in brain connectivity before and after a stem cell transfusion. 

> A. K. Simhal, K. L. H. Carpenter, J. Kurtzberg, A. Song, A. Tannenbaum, L. Zhang, G. Sapiro, G. Dawson. “Changes in the geometry and robustness of diffusion tensor imaging net- works: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial of young autistic children receiving an umbilical cord blood infusion.” 2022. Frontiers in Psychiatry.

Cervical Cancer & Machine Learning (SVM models)
--------
We developed an image processing pipeline to automate detections of various cervical lesions taken via a pocket colposcope.

Autism Spectrum Disorders & Random Forest Models
----------
The first paper uses random forest (RF) models to figure what helps kids with ASD successfully complete MRI scans. The second uses RF to model survey data to examine what helped kids with ASD through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Synapse Biology & Image Processing
-----------
This trio of papers presents a novel unsupervised method for synapse detection. The method, designed for array tomography, detects and characterizes synapses and astrocytes in mouse brain tissue. The method was used to examine synaptic differences in mouse models of fragile X syndrome, a type of ASD. I've presented this work at various meetings and multiple labs have adapted the methodology into their pipelines.
