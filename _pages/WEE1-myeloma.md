### Background 

Thanks for your interest in this work! This project was inspired by our orignal work taking an unsupervised network-based approach to a large multiple myeloma data. This paper, [Gene interaction network analysis in multiple myeloma detects complex immune dysregulation associated with shorter survival - Blood Cancer Journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-023-00935-2), described a novel eight gene signature associated with high-risk multiple myeloma: *BUB1*, *MCM6*, *NOSTRIN*, *PAM*, *RNF115*, *SNCAIP*, *SPRR2A*, & *WEE1*. 

### IMS 2024 Project

Of all 8 genes, *WEE1* was the most prognostic. So we decided to do a deeper dive and fully explore the prognostic value of WEE1 in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and how it alters gene expression. These results are shared as a poster for the 2024 International Myeloma Society meeting and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/aksimhal/posters/blob/master/IMS2024/IMS2024_Simhal.pdf.). 


If you also work on WEE1 or other cell cycle genes, Iâ€™d love to hear from you! Please email me at simhala [at] mskcc [dot] org.
